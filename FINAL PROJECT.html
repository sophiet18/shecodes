    <h1>Where's my snooze button‚ùì</h1>
    <h2>Sleep what sleep?</h2>
    <p><strong>In short, it is a survival mechanism. </strong><br>According to the <a
            href="https://www.sleepassociation.org/about-sleep/what-is-sleep/" target="blank">American Sleep Association</a>, sleep is when
        our body repairs and replenishes itself even when we don't feel it. Just as we run on different time zones, our body
        has its internal clocks (circadian rhythm) For example, growth hormone goes to work and spikes during our
        sleep!</br></p>

        <h2>The 4 stages of sleepüí§</h2>
    <p><strong>Non Rapid Eye Movement (NREM 1)</strong>
        <br>
        These are the initial 5-10 minutes when we tether between falling asleep and being awake. For some, it may not even
        feel like sleeping! Since sleep stages are named after eye movements, the initial 3 stages are similar in that
        regard but not entirely!
        </br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>NREM 2</strong>
        <br>This stage typically lasts for ~20 minutes. Here, body temperature, heart rate, and breathing gradually slows
        down. Despite only lasting 20 minutes, one spends most of an entire night‚Äôs sleep here
        </br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>NREM 3</strong>
        <br>
        This stage commences deep sleep. One becomes unresponsive to the environment and muscles are the most relaxed, it is
        very hard to wake someone from this stage.
        </br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Rapid Eye Movement (REM)</strong>
        <br>
        Dream on! This is when dreaming occurs and when our muscles and brain become polar opposites - very relaxed and very
        active respectively. Not only does our eyes move rapidly, our respiration and heart rates increase, too! As much as
        our dreams may seem to last forever, this stage only takes up ~20% of our total sleep!
        </br>
    </p>
    </div>
    <span>Afterall,<strong>the quality of sleep is more important than the quantity</strong>. Nevertheless, less than 6
        hours is generally insufficient. Don't forget, as our body rests, some parts of our body are hard at work as we
        cycle through the stages. Sleep, so that you may go further!</span>
